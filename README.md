# HumanActivityRecognitionClassification

<H2>This ML project aims to classify / predict correct labels of human activity based on the input features (body movement readings).</H2>
<br/>
Target column labels are (Activities)-
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

<br/>
Input features are acc, velocity etc in all directions X,Y,Z Vectors -- There are approx 500+ feature columns on which we have train model to predict correct label.
